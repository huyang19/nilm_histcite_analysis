AB Indoor positioning systems (IPSes) can enable many location-based
   services in large indoor environments where GPS is not available or
   reliable. Mobile crowdsourcing is widely advocated as an effective way
   to construct IPS maps. This paper presents the first systematic study of
   security issues in crowd-sourced WiFi-based IPSes to promote security
   considerations in designing and deploying crowdsourced IPSes. We
   identify three attacks on crowdsourced WiFi-based IPSes and propose the
   corresponding countermeasures. The efficacy of the attacks and also our
   countermeasures are experimentally validated on a prototype system. The
   attacks and countermeasures can be easily extended to other crowdsourced
   IPSes.
