AB Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) devices enabled visible light communication (VLC) for Internet of things (IoT) applications has attracted extensive attentions from both academic and industrial communities, thanks to the pervasive deployments of light emitting diode (LED) lighting infrastructure. However, due to the limitation of frequency response and non-linearity of the commercial illuminating LED light consisting of multiple LED chips, the achievable data rate is far less than that provided by the experimental VLC system with a single LED with specialized devices, e.g., lens. To this end, we propose a power-of-2 arrangement scheme for LED chips to generate spatial summing modulation with low control complexity, and demonstrate its availability in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) VLC system purely built upon COTS devices. It significantly differs from a conventional OFDM VLC system relying on digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and analog signal chain, which is complex and confined by LED's non-linearity, thanks to we design a novel digital-to-light converter (DLC) which can output 256 light intensities linearly and be directly controlled by the discrete digital signals generated by the OFDM modulator. An experimental demonstration with employing the QAM-OFDM modulation scheme successfully confirms the effectiveness of the proposed spatial summing VLC system, which can achieve low BERs of below the forward error correct (FEC) threshold of 3.8 x 10(-3) for both QAM8 and QAM16 running transmission frequency of 300 kHz under a communication distance of 0.8 m. It demonstrates the promising potential for delivering a data rate at hundred kbps level with this novel spatial summing based OFDM VLC system, which is sufficient for many IoT applications.

AB In this paper, we propose and evaluate a novel light-emitting diode (LED) nonlinearity estimation and compensation scheme using probabilistic Bayesian learning (PBL) for spectral-efficient visible light communication (VLC) systems. The nonlinear power-current curve of the LED transmitter can be accurately estimated by exploiting PBL regression and hence the adverse effect of LED nonlinearity can be efficiently compensated. Simulation results show that, in a 80-Mbit/s orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based nonlinear VLC system, comparable bit-error rate (BER) performance can be achieved by the conventional time domain averaging (TDA)-based LED nonlinearity mitigation scheme with totally 20 training symbols (TSs) and the proposed PBL-based scheme with only a single TS. Therefore, compared with the conventional TDA scheme, the proposed PBL-based scheme can substantially reduce the required training overhead and hence greatly improve the overall spectral efficiency of bandlimited VLC systems. It is also shown that the PBL-based LED nonlinearity estimation and compensation scheme is computational efficient for the implementation in practical VLC systems.

AB Visible light communication (VLC) systems utilizing conventional superposition coding/successive interference cancellation (SPC/SIC)-based non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) suffer from the error propagation effect due to imperfect SIC. In this letter, we propose a flexible-rate SIC-free NOMA technique for downlink VLC systems, based on constellation partitioning coding (CPC) and uneven constellation demapping (UCD). By using CPC/UCD, SIC is not required and hence error propagation can be eliminated in NOMA-based VLC systems. Moreover, by selecting a proper bit allocation scheme, flexible-rate multiple access can be supported in the VIC system applying CPC/UCD-based NOMA. Proof-of-concept two-user VLC experiments verify that, compared with conventional SPC/SIC-based NOMA, the bit error rate performance of the near user can be greatly improved by using CPC/UCD-based NOMA, and hence the effective power allocation ratio range can be substantially extended.

AB Visible Light Communication (VLC) systems relying on commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) devices have gathered momentum recently, due to the pervasive adoption of LED lighting and mobile devices. However, the achievable throughput by such practical systems is still several orders below those claimed by controlled experiments with specialized devices. In this paper, we engineer SynLight aiming to significantly improve the data rate of a practical VLC system. SynLight adopts COTS LEDs as its transmitter, but it innovates in its simple yet delicate driver circuit wiring an array of LED chips in a combinatorial manner. Consequently, modulated signals can directly drive the on-off procedures of individual chip groups, so that the spatially synthesized light emissions exhibit a varying luminance following exactly the modulation symbols. To obtain a readily usable receiver, SynLight interfaces a COTS Photo-Diode with a smartphone through the audio jack. The evaluations on SynLight are both promising and informative: they demonstrate a throughput up to 60 kbps, more than 50x of that achieved by state-of-the-art systems, while suggesting various potentials to further enhance the performance.

AB In this paper, a 3D indoor visible light positioning (VLP) system with fast computation time using received signal strength (RSS) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. Assisted by the deep learning techniques, the complexity of the trilateration problem is greatly reduced, and the trilateration problem can be formulated as a linear mapping leading to faster position estimation than the conventional estimation. Moreover, a new method of off-line preparation is adopted to minimize the workload of the VLP system deployment for more practical usage. The proposition is implemented on an atto-cellular VLP unit, through which the real-time performance and positioning accuracy are demonstrated and validated in a 3D positioning experiment performed in a space of 1.2 x 1.2 x 2 m(3). The experimental results show that a positioning accuracy of 11.93 cm in confidence of 90% is achieved with 50 times faster the computation time compared to the conventional scheme.

AB In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a secure and private non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based visible light communication (VLC) system. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation is applied in the system and a two-level chaotic encryption scheme is further implemented, which can guarantee both the security of legitimate users against eavesdroppers and the privacy among all the legitimate users. An experimental demonstration with two legitimate users and one eavesdropper successfully verifies the feasibility of the proposed secure and private NOMA VLC system. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that simultaneous security and privacy improvement is considered for NOMA VLC systems.

DE Traffic guidance; Evolutionary game; Replication dynamic; Intensity
   coefficient; Evolutionary stability strategy
AB In the urban traffic system, due to the macroscopic characteristics of the road network information, the driver cannot fully grasp the real-time dynamic traffic information, which is bound to form a game with the induced information provided by the traffic manager. At the same time, there are also game conflicts among the group drivers. In this paper, evolutionary game theory is used to analyze the interaction between drivers' path selection behavior under information-induced conditions and the game relationship between them. The evolutionary model of driver's path selection behavior under induced conditions is established. And based on the improved replication dynamic equation, the intensity coefficient was introduced for quantitative analysis, which extended the changes of different drivers choosing different paths. The research shows that the evolution of the equilibrium point is related to the driver's natural growth rate, the value of the natural growth rate is different, and finally different evolutionary steady states are determined. After a comprehensive discussion of various situations, some suggestions on how to flexibly implement practical induction strategies according to the distribution of evolutionary stability strategies are proposed, which provides theoretical support for alleviating traffic pressure to a certain extent.

DE Sustainable sensor networks; indoor energy harvesting; duty-cycle;
   synchronization
AB Whereas a lot of efforts have been put on energy conservation in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), the limited lifetime of these systems still hampers their practical deployments. This situation is further exacerbated indoors, as conventional energy harvesting (e.g., solar) may not always work. To enable long-lived indoor sensing, we report in this article a self-sustaining sensing system that draws energy from indoor environments, adapts its duty-cycle to the harvested energy, and pays back the environment by enhancing the awareness of the indoor microclimate through an "energy-free" sensing. First of all, given the pervasive operation of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems indoors, our system harvests energy from airflow introduced by the HVAC systems to power each sensor node. Secondly, as the harvested power is tiny, an extremely low but synchronous duty-cycle has to be applied whereas the system gets no energy surplus to support existing synchronization schemes. So, we design two complementary synchronization schemes that cost virtually no energy. Finally, we exploit the feature of our harvester to sense the airflow speed in an energy-free manner. To our knowledge, this is the first indoor wireless sensing system that encapsulates energy harvesting, network operating, and sensing all together.

DT Article
DE Occupancy inference; Visible Light Sensing; Statistical learning
AB As a key component of building management and security, occupancy inference through smart sensing has attracted a lot of research attention for nearly two decades. Nevertheless, existing solutions mostly rely on either pre-deployed infrastructures or user device participation, thus hampering their wide adoption. This paper presents CeilingSee, a dedicated occupancy inference system free of heavy infrastructure deployments and user involvements. Building upon existing LED lighting systems, CeilingSee converts part of the ceiling-mounted LED luminaires to act as sensors, sensing the variances in diffuse reflection caused by occupants. In realizing CeilingSee, we first re-design the LED driver to leverage LED's photoelectric effect so as to transform a light emitter to a light sensor. In order to produce accurate occupancy inference, we then engineer efficient learning algorithms to fuse sensing information gathered by multiple LED luminaires. We build a testbed covering a 30 m(2) office area; extensive experiments show that CeilingSee is able to achieve very high accuracy in occupancy inference. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Using modeling and simulation methods, a hierarchical structure model of origin-destination (OD) travel process of driver's route choice under guidance information is explored based on fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) which is a fuzzy version of analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Firstly, a Logit model of driver's route choice is presented based on the Bayesian theory, and then combining it with dynamic route choice model based on decision field theory (DFT), a solution of NASH equilibrium game is given under complete dynamic information. Secondly, an FAHP was used to establish the hierarchical structural model of the OD travel process of driver's route choice. Finally, an example is given to demonstrate the optimal solution. The results show that driver preferences, behavior characteristics and route characteristics, the acceptance degree of guidance information, and avoiding difficult route are the key factors for driver's route choice.

DE Ensemble; occupancy inference; visible light sensing
AB As a key component of building management and security, occupancy inference through smart sensing has attracted a lot of research attention for nearly two decades. Recently, a cutting edge technique visible light sensing (VLS) that utilizes the LED luminaires as light sensors has shown its promising application potentials in occupancy inference as it piggybacks on pervasive lighting infrastructure without extra equipment deployment. Although existing inference algorithms based on the VLS data set can achieve high accuracy, the performance degrades when the occupants are moving. This paper focuses on the occupancy inference issue and presents an ensemble learning algorithm to improve the inference accuracy. We use heterogeneous learning algorithms to generate diverse learners. Consequently, we adopt forward sequential pruning to enhance the ensemble that pursues inference error minimization. We conduct extensive experiments based on the field data. The experiment results show that the proposed algorithm is able to improve inference accuracy, especially for highly dynamic occupancy data set.

AB Although Visible Light Communication (VLC) is gaining increasing attention in research, developing a practical VLC system to harness its immediate benefits using Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) devices is still an open issue. To this end, we develop and deploy CeilingTalk as a lightweight wireless broadcast system using COTS LED luminaries as transmitters and smartphone cameras as receivers so that it can be fully hosted in a smartphone and is feasible for all possible indoor environments. CeilingTalk innovates in both encoding and decoding to achieve an adequate throughput for realistic applications. On one hand, it employs Raptor coding to allow multiple LED luminaries to transmit collaboratively so as to benefit both throughput and reliability. On the other hand, it involves a lightweight decoding scheme to handle the asynchrony (both spatial and temporal) in transmissions. Moreover, we analyze the impact of various parameters on the performance of CeilingTalk, in order to derive a model for such VLC systems enabled by COTS devices and hence provide general guidance for future VLC deployments in larger scales. Finally, we conduct extensive field experiments to validate the effectiveness of our LED-camera VLC model, as well as to demonstrate the promising performance of CeilingTalk: up to 1.0 kb/s at a distance of 5 m.

AB For the deficiency of long running time and large complexity of traditional MES job scheduling algorithm, this paper adopts a optimal scheduling approach based on rules. It performs optimized operations with the conditions of the longest relative surplus. The scheduling rule ensures the priority scheduling of the longest process, which can solve the optimal solution of each partial scheduling by comparing relative remaining period of the competitive process set of the scheduling process in partially scheduled set, to achieve global optimum or approximate optimum of the overall optimum. The tests demonstrate that the improved algorithm can ensure the computing speed when confronting complex scheduling and approach the optimum solution under constrict conditions by shorten the entire duration of project, which shows strong practical value in actual work.

AB While the traditional Visible Light Communication (VLC) system has attracted a lot of research attentions on boosting throughput, using Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) devices, e.g. existing cameras on the smartphones, is a recent trend to implement readily deployable VLC systems. In particular, since LED-Camera VLC systems have shown a promising potential in large indoor communication due to the growing deployment of LED lighting infrastructure, a comprehensive VLC system with cooperative transmission and roaming support has become an impending need. To this end, we propose a novel VLC and visible light sensing (VLS) system to address that by leveraging LED sensing and effective encoding/decoding schemes. It is achieved first by utilizing LED sensing via converting parts of LED luminaire into light sensors to detect diffuse reflection change caused by presence of the user. After the users are detected and located, the system employs rateless codes and newly designed code assignment scheme to collaboratively transmit to detected users in their communication cells. We believe the proposed system has the potential to a roaming support VLC system in the whole building or indoor areas.

AB As a key component of building management and security, occupancy inference through smart sensing has attracted a lot of research attentions for nearly two decades. Nevertheless, existing solutions mostly rely on either pre-deployed infrastructures or user device participation, thus hampering their wide adoption. This paper presents CeilingSee, a dedicated occupancy inference system free of heavy infrastructure deployments and user involvements. Building upon existing LED lighting systems, CeilingSee converts part of the ceiling-mounted LED luminaires to act as sensors, sensing the variances in diffuse reflection caused by occupants. In realizing CeilingSee, we first re-design the LED driver to leverage LED's photoelectric effect so as to transform a light emitter to a light sensor. In order to produce accurate occupancy inference, we then engineer efficient learning algorithms to fuse sensing information gathered by multiple LED luminaires. We build a testbed covering a 30m(2) office area; extensive experiments show that CeilingSee is able to achieve very high accuracy in occupancy inference.

AB Although Visible Light Communication (VLC) is gaining increasing attentions in research, developing a practical VLC system to harness its immediate benefits using Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) devices is still an open issue. To this end, we develop and deploy CeilingCast as a location-bound wireless broadcast system using COTS LEDs as transmitters and smartphone cameras as receivers. CeilingCast innovates in its effective coding and efficient decoding schemes, so that it can be fully hosted in a smartphone and is feasible for all possible indoor environments. Moreover, we analyze the impact of various parameters on the performance of CeilingCast, in order to derive a model for such VLC systems enabled by COTS devices and hence provide general guidance for future VLC deployments in larger scales. Finally, we conduct extensive field experiments to validate the effectiveness of our LED-camera VLC model, as well as to demonstrate the promising performance of CeilingCast under various parameters.
