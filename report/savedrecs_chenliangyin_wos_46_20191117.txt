AB Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) devices enabled visible light communication (VLC) for Internet of things (IoT) applications has attracted extensive attentions from both academic and industrial communities, thanks to the pervasive deployments of light emitting diode (LED) lighting infrastructure. However, due to the limitation of frequency response and non-linearity of the commercial illuminating LED light consisting of multiple LED chips, the achievable data rate is far less than that provided by the experimental VLC system with a single LED with specialized devices, e.g., lens. To this end, we propose a power-of-2 arrangement scheme for LED chips to generate spatial summing modulation with low control complexity, and demonstrate its availability in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) VLC system purely built upon COTS devices. It significantly differs from a conventional OFDM VLC system relying on digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and analog signal chain, which is complex and confined by LED's non-linearity, thanks to we design a novel digital-to-light converter (DLC) which can output 256 light intensities linearly and be directly controlled by the discrete digital signals generated by the OFDM modulator. An experimental demonstration with employing the QAM-OFDM modulation scheme successfully confirms the effectiveness of the proposed spatial summing VLC system, which can achieve low BERs of below the forward error correct (FEC) threshold of 3.8 x 10(-3) for both QAM8 and QAM16 running transmission frequency of 300 kHz under a communication distance of 0.8 m. It demonstrates the promising potential for delivering a data rate at hundred kbps level with this novel spatial summing based OFDM VLC system, which is sufficient for many IoT applications.

AB Visible Light Communication (VLC) systems relying on commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) devices have gathered momentum recently, due to the pervasive adoption of LED lighting and mobile devices. However, the achievable throughput by such practical systems is still several orders below those claimed by controlled experiments with specialized devices. In this paper, we engineer SynLight aiming to significantly improve the data rate of a practical VLC system. SynLight adopts COTS LEDs as its transmitter, but it innovates in its simple yet delicate driver circuit wiring an array of LED chips in a combinatorial manner. Consequently, modulated signals can directly drive the on-off procedures of individual chip groups, so that the spatially synthesized light emissions exhibit a varying luminance following exactly the modulation symbols. To obtain a readily usable receiver, SynLight interfaces a COTS Photo-Diode with a smartphone through the audio jack. The evaluations on SynLight are both promising and informative: they demonstrate a throughput up to 60 kbps, more than 50x of that achieved by state-of-the-art systems, while suggesting various potentials to further enhance the performance.

AB The civil aviation industry is undergoing rapid development. However, the on-time rate of airport flights and passenger service quality are not particularly satisfying. The cause of the above problems is the contradiction between the limited operational support capability and the continuous growth of passenger traffic volume. Therefore, the key to solving these problems is achieving situation awareness of airport operation. Many situation awareness algorithms, typically categorized into modeling and machine learning, have been proposed in the past years. However, existing models lack flexibility and their prediction accuracy is unstable. Machine learning's results cannot be timely and effective when external conditions are suddenly changed although some related algorithms have higher accuracy because of the retraining of artificial neural network (ANN). This paper proposes a situation awareness method based on Petri nets (PNs). This method introduces the queuing theory and perceptual parameters into the existing PN and constructs the perceptual PNs' model for general service systems so that it can quickly model different scene service systems. In combination with the ANN, this paper proposes a complete situation awareness algorithm to realize a sustained and accurate situation awareness prediction of the service system by solving point estimations of the macroscopic and microscopic situation in this model, which helps to address some challenges faced by current civil aviation airports. By experimenting on-ground support in civil aviation airports and the access of website as well as comparing the situation separately with Airport Collaborative Decision Making and stochastic PNs, the validity and accuracy of the algorithm proposed in this paper are well verified.

AB As node's characteristics that they are self-governed and resource-limited, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) face potential threats due to various attacks, among which the most threatening attack is wormhole attack. Wormhole attack severely imperils WSNs and is difficult to be detected, for it causes incorrect routing by private tunnels and damages to WSNs in terms of data leakage, data dropping, and delayed delivery. However, the existing solutions are based on additional hardware, incur high communication overhead, or fail to give consideration to all types of wormholes. In this paper, we propose CREDND, a protocol for creating a Credible Neighbor Discovery against wormholes in WSN, which can detect not only external wormholes through the hop difference between the own exclusive neighbors but also internal wormholes through enabling the common neighbor nodes as witnesses to monitor whether the authentication packets are forwarded by malicious nodes. CREDND is a simple, localized protocol and needs no special hardware, localization, or synchronization, but it improves the ability of wormhole defense. The simulation results are provided, showing that CREDND outperforms in wormhole detection than other same types of solutions.

ID NONORTHOGONAL MULTIPLE-ACCESS; COMMUNICATION-SYSTEM; PERFORMANCE
AB In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a secure and private non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based visible light communication (VLC) system. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation is applied in the system and a two-level chaotic encryption scheme is further implemented, which can guarantee both the security of legitimate users against eavesdroppers and the privacy among all the legitimate users. An experimental demonstration with two legitimate users and one eavesdropper successfully verifies the feasibility of the proposed secure and private NOMA VLC system. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that simultaneous security and privacy improvement is considered for NOMA VLC systems.

AB It is a challenging issue to improve the energy efficiency of neighbor discovery in WSNs. This paper proposes an optimal discovery model (ODM) for the first time. Based on the model, we investigate the influence of the relative size of two unequal active slots on the energy efficiency. ODM provides the energy optimal value of the length of the larger active slot at a given duty cycle. Other than existing methods, the worst-case latency bound of ODM is only one period. This is a subversive conclusion, because almost all other related methods are based on a wake-up schedule that contains several periods. We theoretically deduce that ODM can reduce worst-case discovery latency by 43.89% compared to Searchlight-Trim when their duty cycles are the same. The simulations verify the advantage of ODM.

AB With the quick development of Internet of Things (IoT), one of its important supporting technologies, i.e., wireless sensor networks (WSNs), gets much more attention. Neighbor discovery is an indispensable procedure in WSNs. The existing deterministic neighbor discovery algorithms in WSNs ensure that successful discovery can be obtained within a given period of time, but the average discovery delay is long. It is difficult to meet the need for rapid discovery in mobile low duty cycle environments. In addition, with the rapid development of IoT, the node densities of many WSNs greatly increase. In such scenarios, existing neighbor discovery methods fail to satisfy the requirement in terms of discovery latency under the condition of the same energy consumption. This paper proposes a group-based fast neighbor discovery algorithm (GBFA) to address the issues. By carrying neighbor information in beacon packet, the node knows in advance some potential neighbors. It selects more energy efficient potential neighbors and proactively makes nodes wake up to verify whether these potential neighbors are true neighbors, thereby speeding up neighbor discovery, improving energy utilization efficiency and decreasing network communication load. The evaluation results indicate that, compared with other methods, GBFA decreases the average discovery latency up to at the same energy budget.

AB Conduct disorder (CD) is a psychiatric disorder in children and adolescence. To investigate changes in the power distribution in brain networks between CD and typically developing (TD) groups, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) data of thirty-six subjects were first recorded, and then the data were preprocessed using DPARSF and SPM8. Meanwhile, the power of the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals of ninety brain regions was acquired using the integral of the Welch power spectral density (PSD). Additionally, the powers of the brain regions that reached significance (p < 0.05) were extracted using the bootstrap statistics, in which the standardized z-scores of the powers were used as a reference. The results of the analysis of the changes in power exhibited that there were significant power differences in some pairs of brain regions between the CD and TD groups, indicating a change in the power distribution. In addition, the results also suggest that the total power consumption of brain networks in CD patients is less than that observed in the TD group. Consequently, the study provided a paradigm for establishing quantifiable indicators via the power spectrum approach for the comparison and analysis of the BOLD signal power between CD patients and healthy controls.

AB Capacitance-based perimeter alarm system is a comprehensive, humane, modern new security product. The traditional capacitance-based perimeter alarm system uses the FIR high-order low-pass filter, which leads to a large number of CPU resources occupied and can't remove the noise within the same signal spectrum, so it is easy to produce false alarms. We are the first to introduce wavelet analytical method into the signal processing of capacitance-based perimeter alarm system, used for signal denoising and feature extraction. Our system can not only reserve the original waveform, but also identify the intrusion waveform more accurately, so the recognition accuracy will be greatly improved. The simulation and practical application show that the wavelet algorithm can significantly reduce the number of false alarms and improve the overall performance of the system. At present, our system is with no omission and low false alarm rate. Our average daily false alarm rate is less than 10 times per kilometer, which has obvious advantage compared to other alarm systems with dozens or hundreds times per kilometer.

TI Trajectory-Based Hierarchical Adaptive Forwarding in Vehicular Ad Hoc

SO JOURNAL OF SENSORS
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper proposes a Trajectory-Based Hierarchical Adaptive Forwarding (THAF) scheme, tailored and optimized for the efficient multihop vehicle-to-vehicle (v2v) data delivery in vehicular ad hoc networks. We utilize the trajectories of vehicles provided by GPS-based navigation systems to predict forward delay and access area in a privacy-preserving manner. Different from existing trajectory-based forwarding schemes, we establish a hierarchical VANET topology to optimize forwarding path and adopt adaptive diffusion strategy to forward data in light-traffic situations. Through theoretical analysis and extensive simulation, it is shown that our design performs better than the existing schemes.

AB Wireless sensor networks have been used in many mobile applications such as wildlife tracking and participatory urban sensing. Because of the combination of high mobility and low-duty-cycle operations, it is a challenging issue to reduce discovery delay among mobile nodes, so that mobile nodes can establish connection quickly once they are within each other's vicinity. Existing discovery designs are essentially pairwise based, in which discovery is passively achieved when two nodes are prescheduled to wake up at the same time. In contrast, this work reduces discovery delay significantly by proactively referring wake-up schedules among a group of nodes. Since proactive references incur additional overhead, we introduce a novel selective reference mechanism based on spatiotemporal properties of neighborhood and the mobility of nodes. Our quantitative analysis indicates that the discovery delay of our group-based mechanism is significantly smaller than that of the pairwise one. Our testbed experiments using 40 sensor nodes and extensive simulations confirm the theoretical analysis, showing one order of magnitude reduction in discovery delay compared with legacy pairwise methods in dense, uniformly distributed sensor networks with at most 8.8 percent increase in energy consumption.

TI Lightning: A High-Efficient Neighbor Discovery Protocol for Low Duty

DE Low Duty Cycle WSNs; Neighbor Discovery; Deterministic Algorithm
AB In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), due to the limited energy of nodes, discovering neighbors needs to be achieved in an energy-efficient way. This means that, at a given energy consumption, we need to reduce the worst-case neighbor discovery latency as far as possible. In this letter, we propose a novel deterministic neighbor discovery method, called Lightning. Lightning employs two kinds of active slots of different active lengths (we call A slot and C slot, respectively). The active time of C slot is much shorter than that of A slot in order to reduce the energy consumption. In addition, to maximize the energy efficiency, Lightning adopts one-way neighbor discovery method. This makes C slot have the smallest active length that is only enough to send one beaconing packet. Through proactively sending one beaconing packet after one-way discovery, Lightning also realizes bi-directional neighbor discovery. The theoretical analysis indicates that, with the same energy consumption, our method reduces the worst-case latency bound up to 37.9% compared with Searchlight-Trim, the best existing discovery algorithm. The simulation verifies the soundness and effectiveness of our design.

AB Node localisation for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is applied in various fields, and is an indispensable core to promote the development of WSNs. Since the previous localisation algorithms did not fully utilise the anisotropy of nodes, according to the actual radiation model of the node's communication, a novel range-free localisation algorithm called range-free localisation based on the anisotropy of nodes (RLAN) is proposed. RLAN not only uses the information of multi-hop neighbours, but also considers fully the anisotropy of nodes in real networks, which influences the hop relationship and average hop distance, so as to improve the accuracy of node localisation. The simulation results demonstrate that RLAN has better localisation accuracy than other range-free node localisation algorithms. When the nodes are relatively uniformly deployed in the localisation area, the normalised localisation average error using RLAN can be <17%.

TI Rumor Identification in Microblogging Systems Based on Users' Behavior
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE Microblog; rumor identification; users' behavior
AB In recent years, microblog systems such as Twitter and Sina Weibo have averaged multimillion active users. On the other hand, the microblog system has become a new means of rumor-spreading platform. In this paper, we investigate the machine-learning-based rumor identification approaches. We observed that feature design and selection has a stronger impact on the rumor identification accuracy than the selection of machine-learning algorithms. Meanwhile, the rumor publishers' behavior may diverge from normal users', and a rumor post may have different responses from a normal past. However, mass behavior on rumor posts has not been explored adequately. Hence, we investigate rumor identification schemes by applying five new features based on users' behaviors, and combine the new features with the existing well-proved effective user behavior-based features, such as followers' comments and reposting, to predict whether a microblog past is a rumor. Experiment results on real-world data from Sina Weibo demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our proposed method and features. From the experiments, we conclude that the rumor detection based on mass behaviors is more effective than the detection based on microblogs' inherent features.

AB Clustering analysis methods have been widely applied to identifying the functional brain networks of a multitask paradigm. However, the previously used clustering analysis techniques are computationally expensive and thus impractical for clinical applications. In this study a novel method, called SOM-SAPC that combines self-organizing mapping (SOM) and supervised affinity propagation clustering (SAPC), is proposed and implemented to identify the motor execution (ME) and motor imagery (MI) networks. In SOM-SAPC, SOM was first performed to process fMRI data and SAPC is further utilized for clustering the patterns of functional networks. As a result, SOM-SAPC is able to significantly reduce the computational cost for brain network analysis. Simulation and clinical tests involving ME and MI were conducted based on SOM-SAPC, and the analysis results indicated that functional brain networks were clearly identified with different response patterns and reduced computational cost. In particular, three activation clusters were clearly revealed, which include parts of the visual, ME and MI functional networks. These findings validated that SOM-SAPC is an effective and robust method to analyze the fMRI data with multitasks.

AB For real-time applications in mobile low-duty-cycle (DC) wireless sensor networks (WSNs), discovering neighbours needs to be achieved in both short average latency and high fraction of discoveries (FDs) with low energy consumption. A novel asynchronous probabilistic method is proposed, in which a node randomly chooses a prime, e.g. p, from a pre-configured prime set and wakes up only at the first slot during every p continuous slot which is for a hyper-cycle length, i.e. a fixed number continuous slots, determined by the prime sets, and then selects another prime for the next hyper cycle. For low-DCs, especially <2%, one can flexibly configure different prime sets for the given DC, and the more the primes in the sets, the lower the average discovery latency (ADL) that is achieved. Simulations show that the proposed method can not only achieve a shorter ADL than SearchLight, but also obtain a shorter and smaller tail on FDs than Birthday.

AB The error performance of two-hop cooperative communication (CC) systems with transmit antenna selection (TAS) at the source and relay over - fading channels is analysed. The probability density function of the received signal-to-noise ratio and the average bit error rate of two-hop CC systems with a source-destination direct link and TAS at both the source and the relay is derived. The exactness of the analytical expressions is validated by the close agreement of the Monte Carlo simulation results and the analytical results.

TI Why (n+1)th-hop neighbours are more important than nth-hop ones for
   localisation in multi-hop WSNs
SO ELECTRONICS LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
AB For range-free localisation in a wireless sensor network (WSN), the importance of indirect anchor neighbours of an unknown node has been underestimated in the past. In this reported work, for the unknown node, we show that its (n + 1)th-hop anchor neighbours are more useful than its nth-hop ones. By employing a theoretical model to analyse the possible localisation area (PLA) of the unknown node, it is found that the PLA and the hop count are negatively correlated, which indicates that (n + 1) th-hop anchor neighbours can provide more information to more accurately localise the unknown node. Meanwhile, the property of convergence of the theoretical model means that localisation accuracy cannot be unlimitedly improved with increasing hop counts. In the simulations, the presented theory is verified.

TI POPA: localising nodes by splitting PLA with nth-hop anchor neighbours
SO ELECTRONICS LETTERS

DT Article
AB A novel distributed range-free localisation algorithm, named polygonal overlapped possible area (POPA), is proposed to accurately localise an unknown node. First, for an unknown node, to theoretically define its possible localisation area (PLA), virtual radiation regions of its nth-hop anchor neighbours are introduced. Then an effective area-splitting algorithm is employed to simplify and speed up the computation of the possible localisation area. Simulation shows localisation error can be controlled within 20% with off-the-shelf devices.

DT Article
AB A novel distributed range-free localisation algorithm to accurately locate regular nodes in wireless sensor networks is presented. Existing methods reduce the possible area where a regular node would be located by using anchors (i.e. nodes with known locations) only. These methods are effective only when anchor density is high. In contrast, the work presented here reduces the possible area of a regular node iteratively, using both anchor node locations and the possible areas of its neighbouring and non-neighbouring 'regular' nodes from early iteration. This allows a significant improvement in the localisation accuracy. Simulations verify the advantage of the proposed algorithm and show that the localisation error can be controlled within 15% with off-the-shelf devices.

TI An Eliminating Method to Improve Localization Accuracy
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS

DT Article
ID SENSOR; SCHEME
AB Node localization is essential in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, due to limited node energy and overhead network, node localization faces many challenges in WSNs. In addition, it is difficult to meet the requirement of localization accuracy and energy consumption at the same time in existing algorithms. In this paper, we proposed a novel eliminating algorithm called NPLA which achieves high localization accuracy and reduces energy consumption effectively. It makes full use of multiple-hop neighbor nodes of unknown node to eliminate the possible location area (PLA) of the unknown node. Simulations show that the localization error of algorithm NPLA can be controlled within 20%.

TI Twice Deployment Node Balance Algorithm for Road Network Surveillance
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper proposes a twice deployment node balance algorithm (TDNB) which guarantees successful detection of the moving target on road networks. Through dividing the deployment of the sensor nodes into two phases instead of deploying all the sensors at one time, TDNB has a better performance. In the former phase, some of the sensors are deployed on the road at random. In the latter phase, the rest of the sensors are deployed on demand to make the number on each path the same. Due to the equivalence of the node's number, the network will have a prolonged lifetime after inserting nodes into the segment according to this algorithm. TDNB extends the network's lifetime remarkably compared with the former algorithms. Furthermore, TDNB enables us to insert nodes to the segment required in the network instead of all the segments, which reduces the workload to a large extent. In short, without increasing the number of sensors in road network, TDNB has a better performance compared to VISA in terms of network lifetime, which meets the demand for persistent monitoring application.

AB PPPDE peptidase domain 1 (PPPDE1) is a recently identified gene; however, its expression regulation and biological function are unclear. Previous studies have indicated that PPPDE1 is involved in embryogenesis, apoptosis induction and cell cycle regulation. In the present study, we first used an anti-PPPDE1 antibody to determine that endogenous PPPDE1 is located in the Golgi apparatus. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of mouse embryos indicated that PPPDE1 was markedly distributed in liver, skin, intestinal villi, and muscles, whereas Western blot analysis of mouse mature organs revealed its ubiquitous expression, without an appreciable distinction in protein abundance. Surprisingly, another potential isoform of PPPDE1 with a molecular weight of 18 kD (rather than its predicted molecular weight of 21 kD) was detected in the mouse kidney, testis, and intestine. Moreover, microarrays that were derived from twelve tumor types revealed that PPPDE1 expression was significantly lower in pancreas, stomach, and skin tumors compared with normal tissue from these organs. We specifically and extensively analyzed PPPDE1 expression in clinical samples and observed strong associations between PPPDE1 expression and (i) differentiation grade in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and (ii) T stage in skin squamous cell carcinoma. Our data are the first to reveal the expression profile of PPPDE1 protein and its implications in cancer. These results will contribute to the understanding of the expression regulation and biological functions of PPPDE1 in development and carcinogenesis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI Trajectory-Based Optimal Area Forwarding for Infrastructure-to-Vehicle
   Data Delivery with Partial Deployment of Stationary Nodes
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS
LA English
DT Article
ID MOBILITY
AB This paper proposes a trajectory-based optimal area forwarding (TOAF) algorithm tailored for multihop data delivery from infrastructure nodes (e.g., Internet access points) to moving vehicles (infrastructure-to-vehicle) in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) with partial deployment of stationary nodes. It focuses on reducing the delivery-delay jitter and improving the low reliability of infrastructure-to-vehicle communication. To adapt with the real world, TOAF supposes that stationary nodes are partially installed at intersections in VANETs, and nodes' trajectories can be calculated and predicted, such as using cloud services and GPS, to find the optimal area where the destination vehicle may receive a packet timely. AP selects the optimal area from the trajectory of the destination vehicle and determines the delivery sequence, which includes stationary and mobile nodes from the AP to the optimal area. During delivery, if a new node finds that the delay to the next stationary node is less than that of the current carrier, it can be added to the sequence, reducing the delivery delay. The addition of a new node continues until the packet reaches the optimal area and infrastructure-to-vehicle communication is achieved. The simulation results confirm that TOAF can improve the performance of delivery-delay jitters and reliability of infrastructure-to-vehicle communication with partial deployment of stationary nodes.

AB A new type of axisymmetric-fold-combination CO2 laser, which is constituted by several axisymmetric four-mirror cavities, is studied theoretically in this paper. The mutual energy coupling occurring within the communal discharge region of the unstable resonator to inject seed signals into each sub-resonator is demonstrated by theoretical deduction. The numerical results have proved that phase-locking could be achieved in this cavity, and the beams with phase-locking have both a higher intensity and a smaller light spot than the ones without phase-locking.

AB An axisymmetric-fold-combination (ASFC) cavity composed of two planar mirrors and spherical mirrors was designed. It is a stable-unstable resonator cavity. The light field of radial direction is Gaussian distribution. And in angular orientation, the distribution keeps invariant. It could generate annular CO(2) laser beam with excellent spatial coherence. And the spatial coherence is commendably realized with its stable-unstable cavity structure. The output light intensity distribution of this special model was discussed and simulated. With exterior lenses group. the output beams can be adjusted and controlled better to meet the manufactural requirements. Some references were provided for further research of the cavity with cylindrical discharge region. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the field of reliable multicast, the design of most current router cache management protocols is limited by network environment with single multicast group. With such protocols, expected targets can not be achieved in Internet environment in which a router is shared by a plurality of multicast groups. ACP is a router cache management protocol suitable for the environment shared by multiple groups. In Internet in which there exists frequently emerged bursty data flow, however, ACP allocation algorithm has such drawbacks as slow convergence and instable allocation results when the number of multicast groups or group members changes. Based on the design and implementation of a dynamic cache allocation algorithm as well as time-out algorithm and packet discard policy, a novel Adaptive and Active Reliable Multicast Protocol (AARM for short) suitable for large-scale multicast network was proposed. Simulation results show that AARM will achieve significant enhancement of performance for multicast network in terms of delayed restoration, bandwidth consumption and network throughput, etc. compared with ACP.

AB The Embedded Systems are now in use more commonly in our daily lives. They can accomplish many complicated tasks in different working environments, and concurrency and synchronization are ordinary problems. the embedded software usually must be confronted with. This issue presents a novel method for controlling such problems efficiently. To avoid the inefficiency or collision induced by directly coupling amongst multi-tasks that conventional methods mostly did, software agent architecture designing can cope with such work more properly. The main work of this article includes designing agent architecture for typical concurrency embedded system applications, and adapting classic RMA for scheduling tasks which have soft real time requirements. Lastly, a case study has been done on a typical embedded system scenario, where multi-peripheral devices parallel processing is analyzed with this method and the results show that can get a good concurrence performance.

AB Diffusion characteristics of a joint-proton source for proton exchange in LiNbO3 are presented. With a concentration-dependent diffusivity derived from experimental results, the diffusion process is simulated to estimate the proton-exchanged wet-etched depth. Good agreement between simulated cord measured depth is obtained. In addition, an S-shaped ridge waveguide is fabricated to demonstrate the improvement in power transmission efficiency.

AB In order to share multimedia transmissions in mesh networks and optimize the utilization of network resources, this paper presents a Two-stage Evolutionary Algorithm (TEA), i.e., unicast routing evolution and multicast path composition, for dynamic multicast routing. The TEA uses a novel link-duplicate-degree encoding, which can encode a multicast path in the link-duplicate-degree and decode the path as a link vector easily. A dynamic algorithm for adding nodes to or removing nodes from a multicast group and a repairing algorithm are also covered in this paper. As the TEA is based on global evaluation, the quality of the multicast path remains stabilized without degradation when multicast members change over time. Therefore, it is not necessary to rearrange the multicast path during the life cycle of the multicast sessions. Simulation results show that the TEA is efficient and convergent.

AB Millions of people are enjoying the convenience of transferring money and shopping with mobile e-business, but at great risk. Because of the risk, security should be considered a fundamental aspect of e-business system design. Mobile wireless e-business system inherently possesses a higher degree of risk than wired e-business applications, and it requires greater level of security and trust. Special attention must be paid to the mobile e-business. With a well-established infrastructure of 3G system, and with the advent of trusted computing and gene identification technology, this kind of situation will be changed greatly. This paper introduces the trusted platform module, the gene theory and their possible application in the mobile e-business system. It proposes that gene identification (GI) module should be embedded in TPM (Trust Platform Module), 3GTT (3G Trusted Terminal) and TC PC (Trust Computing PC) to ensure the trust of each node in the 3G mobile e-business system. It is a theoretically effective method to present the possibility of solving these security and trust issues.

AB Benzocyclobutene directional couplers and 1 x 2 multimode interference (MMI) power splitters fabricated by ultraviolet (UV) pulsed-laser illumination are presented. With an accurate control of the fabrication process, the measured coupling lengths of the directional couplers are in good agreement with those simulated by the beam propagation method. In particular, accurate power splitting ratios of the directional couplers can be achieved by controlling the number of laser shots to obtain the required index changes. Moreover, MMI power splitters with accurate interference lengths and low imbalances can be successfully fabricated. All those reveal that UV pulsed-laser illumination is an accurate and controllable technique for the device fabrication.

DE software testing; embedded system; time complexity; architecture design
AB Architecture design and software implementation both contribute to the correctness of ultimate software products. So performance testing is very helpful to test the inconsistence between design and implementation since it is the mix reflection of both sides. Especially in embedded system, with limited resources, execution time is more likely to expose hidden defects. This research presents a time performance analysis method for software testing. Firstly, software modules were divided according to functionality in architecture view, and their time complexity were computed in static; Secondly, testing activities were designed to track running time cost of those modules; Next, expected time complexity was compared with actual running time to figure out abnormal function modules defects resident. Lastly, experiments were conducted in an embedded software project. The results showed time performance testing is an efficient way to find out some kinds of defects concerned with the inconsistence of design and implementation.

AB In this study, a two-dimensional floating pier consists of single rectangular impermeable pontoon with side supporting pile-columns is studied. The purpose of this study is to present a theoretical solution for the linearized problem of incident waves exerting on a floating pier with pile-restrained. All boundary conditions are linearized in the problem, which is incorporated into a scattering problem and radiation problem with unit displacement. The method of separation of variables is used to solve for velocity potentials. For the radiation problem with unit heave and pitch amplitude, the boundary value problem with non-homogeneous boundary condition beneath the structure is solved by using a solution scheme. By calculating the wave force from velocity potential and solving the equation of motion of the floating structure simultaneously a close form theoretical solution for the problem is developed. The finite element method was also applied to calculate the dynamic responses on the supporting piles subjected to the pontoon motions and incident waves. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Buried-type benzocyclobutene (BCB) optical waveguides fabricated by UV pulsed-laser illumination are proposed and comprehensively characterized in this paper. The fabrication process is greatly simplified as compared to conventional dry-etched ridge-type BCB waveguides. The measured propagation loss at 1548 nm is as low as 0.6 dB/cm due to the buried waveguide structure. And the produced refractive index change is dependent upon the number of laser shots such that single-mode waveguides; with different mode sizes can be tailored for efficient coupling. Furthermore, rigorous analyses of surface damage threshold, rms roughness, and chemical characteristics under different illumination conditions are presented to illustrate the design considerations and the chemical mechanism of the UV-induced BCB waveguides.

AB This paper describes new strategies for scheduling and executing workflow applications on Grid resources using the Unifying Infrastructure in Image-guided Surgery (UIIS). Workflow scheduling is based on heuristic scheduling strategies that use combined computational and memory hierarchy application component performance models. The workflow is executed using a novel strategy to bind and launch the application onto heterogeneous resources. We apply these strategies in the context of launching image-guided surgery, a Bio-imaging workflow application, onto the Grid.

AB Because of the complexity of the hospital environment, there exist a lot of medical information systems for cancer collaboration projects from different vendors with incompatible structures. In order to establish an enterprise hospital information system for cancer collaboration projects, the integration among these heterogeneous systems must be considered. Complete integration should cover three aspects: data integration, function integration and workflow integration. However most of the previous design of architecture did not accomplish such a complete integration. This article offers an architecture design of the hospital information system for cancer collaboration projects based on the concept of digital neural network system in hospital. It covers all three aspects of integration, and eventually achieves the target of one virtual data center with Enterprise Viewer for users of different roles. We present Hospital Information System for Cancer Collaboration Projects (HISCCP), a modular data and process management system designed to provide the infrastructure and environment for a collaborative cancer research project. This system can be further extended to other collaboration projects to achieve a complete solution to research and clinical problems.

AB Computer users, managers, and developers all would agree that we need software and systems which are "more secure." Such efforts will require support from both the education and training communities to improve software assurance-particularly in writing secure code. So, we need to add secure programming content to educate secure programming skills in programming curricula in university. Based on this idea, we write a textbook-the C programming language (C99 version), which adopted a novel organization architecture, included some secure programming content and published by tsinghua university publishing company in China in 2006. And we used this book as a textbook in school of computer science, Sichuan University, China. After nearly two years later, we find that secure programming skills is very important for a student of computer science, and the textbook is helpful to educate the secure skills of the student. This paper discusses the secure programming content organization of the book, and compares the effect of using the book with the old style book. And it also proposed a preferable teaching method, that is the "completion" method which requires students to complete part-complete solutions to given programming problems. Recur to this method, students can understand the program deeply and after a lot of exercises the students maybe have the capability to solve the complex problem. [1].

AB Service classification is not only an indispensable method for manually browsing and managing service repositories, but can in fact be used for simple but efficient forms of service annotation and semi-automated discovery, complementary aid for automatic selection. In order to classify services in a service taxonomy dynamically, a new service classification model based on immune theory is proposed in this paper The concepts of "self", "nonself" and "filter" are given first. Then the model is described in detail. Finally, a simulation experiment is performed, and the important parameters of the model are analyzed The experimental result shows that the new model possess better adaptability and stability.

AB Reinforcement learning belongs to machine learning, with the autonomous learning method that can improve its action policy by interacting with environment. In order to improve the efficiency of grid service selection, a new approach based on improved reinforcement Q-learning for dynamic grid service selection is proposed The environment of Grid service selection is a nondeterministic Markov decision processes (MDPs), and the study of grid service selection learning method is a challenge to current reinforcement learning which is based on MDPs. This paper proposes a correlative improved method for dynamic grid service selection. The experiment results show that the novel method is more effective in some aspects than traditional ones. Therefore it provides a good solution to select grid service.

AB By adding lithium carbonate into a mixture of benzoic and adipic acids as the proton-exchange source, the wet-etched ridge structure in x-cut LiNbO3 is successfully fabricated. Both the etched depths and profiles are demonstrated to be outperformed those of the traditional wet etching method using pure benzoic acid, which is diluted by lithium benzoate. Meanwhile, the etched surfaces are shown to be very smooth. The proposed wet etching method can be further applied to fabricate high-quality components with ridge structure in x-cut LiNbO3.

AB Many researchers focus on enhancing the flexibility of the workflow management system. This paper shows how simulation plays an important role in improving the flexibility of temporal logic based workflow specification (TLWS) model. Detecting the TLWS model's demand for changing and deciding what changes to carry out are very difficult. Simulation analysis can help to do these. After a task is finished, its time, cost and quality will be computed. And each will be compared with dual threshold values. If the value is below the bottom threshold, an exception will be thrown. If it is above this threshold, but below the top threshold, a warning will be sent out. If the value is above the top threshold, the execution is excellent. Workflow specification documents also need to be translated into simulation specification documents by using XLST. The utility of using simulation in improving the flexibility of TLWS model is outstanding.
