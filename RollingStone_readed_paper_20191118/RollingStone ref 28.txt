AB A two phase hybrid algorithm for estimating the location of a mobile
   node, which has the capability of measuring signal strength, azimuth,
   and elevation, in a smart space environment over the visible light
   channel is proposed. In contrast to conventional triangulation
   approaches which are performed in a simplified plane, the smart room
   architecture requires a non-planar solution due to the illumination
   requirement. Furthermore, conventional triangulation approaches can at
   times produce numerically ill-defined solutions, thereby prohibiting a
   notion of target location. Instead of solely relying on triangulation,
   the mobile nodes estimate their locations through a two phase approach
   in which they firstly exploit the signal strength observables with
   unique IDs to establish a coarse estimate, and secondly use the azimuth
   and elevation observables to establish a fine estimate. In many cases,
   the fine estimate will improve upon the coarse estimate; however when
   triangulation fails, the algorithm yields the coarse estimate rather
   than a localization failure. Since the environment model relies on the
   primary requirement of adequate illumination, the number of LED anchors
   and transmit power for communication functions are determined.
   Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the hybrid two phase
   localization approach in a smart space indoor environment by having a
   median coarse phase accuracy of 34.88 cm and a fine phase median
   accuracy of 13.95 cm
