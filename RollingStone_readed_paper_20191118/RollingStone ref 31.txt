AB In this paper, a low-complexity time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) based
   indoor visible light positioning (VLP) system using an enhanced
   practical localization scheme based on cross correlation is proposed and
   experimentally demonstrated The proposed TDOA scheme offers two
   advantages: 1) the use of virtual local oscillator to replace the real
   local oscillator for cross correlation at the receiver side so as to
   reduce the hardware complexity; 2) the application of cubic spline
   interpolation on the correlation function to reduce the rigorous
   requirement on the sampling rate and to enhance the time-resolution of
   cross correlation. In order to achieve the high positioning accuracy
   with minimum implementation complexity, parameter optimization is first
   performed in terms of sampling rate, interpolation factor, and data
   length for correlation. Using the obtained optimal parameters, we
   demonstrate a low-complexity indoor two-dimensional VLP system using the
   correlation-based TDOA scheme in a coverage area of 1.2 x 1.2 m(2) with
   a height of 2 m. The experimental results validate the feasibility of
   the proposed TDOA scheme, and an average positioning accuracy of 9.2 cm
   is achieved with a sampling rate of 500 MSa/s, an interpolation factor
   of 100 and a data length of 250 k samples.
