AB This paper develops a linearized Bayesian inversion algorithm for
   high-precision localization of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) on
   a test range using time difference of arrival acoustic data. The
   Bayesian approach allows the uncertainties of several factors, including
   precise receiver locations and bias and lateral variability of the
   water-column sound-speed profile, to he included in the inversion as
   unknown parameters with varying levels of prior information. This
   provides better estimates of these parameters (and hence AUV locations),
   and includes the effect of their uncertainties in the uncertainty
   estimates for AUV locations. A modeling study comparing AUV localization
   uncertainties from the linearized inversion that results from nonlinear
   Monte Carlo analysis shows that linearization errors are small, and
   hence linearized analysis is used to efficiently map AUV localization
   uncertainty as a function of position over the test range. These
   approaches are applied to model localization uncertainty for an AUV test
   range associated with the Victoria Experimental Network Under the Sea
   cabled observatory system, examining the factors mentioned above as well
   as the effects of water-column refraction and receiver geometry.
