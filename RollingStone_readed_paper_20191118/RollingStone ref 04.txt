AB RFIDs are emerging as a vital component of the Internet of Things. In
   2012, billions of RFIDs have been deployed to locate equipment, track
   drugs, tag retail goods, etc. Current RFID systems, however, can only
   identify whether a tagged object is within radio range (which could be
   up to tens of meters), but cannot pinpoint its exact location. Past
   proposals for addressing this limitation rely on a line-of-sight model
   and hence perform poorly when faced with multipath effects or
   non-line-of-sight, which are typical in real-world deployments.
   This paper introduces the first fine-grained RFID positioning system
   that is robust to multipath and non-line-of-sight scenarios. Unlike past
   work, which considers multipath as detrimental, our design exploits
   multipath to accurately locate RFIDs. The intuition underlying our
   design is that nearby RFIDs experience a similar multipath environment
   (e.g., reflectors in the environment) and thus exhibit similar multipath
   profiles. We capture and extract these multipath profiles by using a
   synthetic aperture radar (SAR) created via antenna motion. We then adapt
   dynamic time warping (DTW) techniques to pinpoint a tag's location. We
   built a prototype of our design using USRP software radios. Results from
   a deployment of 200 commercial RFIDs in our university library
   demonstrate that the new design can locate misplaced books with a median
   accuracy of 11 cm.
