AB LEDs have many advantages compared with the conventional lamps.
   Therefore LEDs are expected to be the next generation of lamps that will
   be widely installed to replace conventional lamps. Due to their rapid
   response times, LED's can be modulated at very high-speeds, which allows
   the possibility of simultaneously providing communication while
   illuminating. Considering these facts, a system can be designed to
   receive (using a single photodiode or a camera) and analyze LED signals.
   Furthermore, such a system should be able to facilitate position
   estimation tasks either for people or vehicles, especially in indoor
   navigation tasks where the LED positions are known. Herein two methods -
   single photo-detector and array photo-detector (camera) - are
   introduced. The single photo-detector approach is used to detect the
   existence and the specific identity of an LED. The array photo-detector
   approach measures the angle-of-arrival of the LED signal. Navigation
   methods based on this measured information is considered.
