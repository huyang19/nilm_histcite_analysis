AB We propose and experimentally demonstrate a practical visible light
   position (VLP) system using repeated unit cells and machine learning
   (ML) algorithms. ML is employed to increase the positioning accuracy.
   Algorithms of the 2nd-order regression ML model and the polynomial
   trilateral ML model are discussed. More than 80% of the measurement data
   have position error within 4 cm when using the 2nd-order regression ML
   model, while the position error is within 5 cm when using the polynomial
   trilateral ML model. (C) 2019 Optical Society of America under the terms
