AB This study was designed to investigate the transient and cumulative
   impairments in spatial and non-spatial memory of C57Bl/6J mice exposed
   to GSM 1.8 GHz signal for 90 min daily by a typical cellular (mobile)
   phone at a specific absorption rate value of 0.11 W/kg. Free-moving male
   mice 2 months old were irradiated in two experimental protocols, lasting
   for 66 and for 148 days respectively. Each protocol used three groups of
   animals (n = 8 each for exposed, sham exposed and controls) in
   combination with two behavioural paradigms, the object recognition task
   and the object location task sequentially applied at different time
   points. One-way analysis of variance revealed statistically significant
   impairments of both types of memory gradually accumulating, with more
   pronounced effects on the spatial memory. The impairments persisted even
   2 weeks after interruption of the 8 weeks daily exposure, whereas the
   memory of mice as detected by both tasks showed a full recovery
   approximately 1 month later. Intermittent every other day exposure for 1
   month had no effect on both types of memory. The data suggest that
   visual information processing mechanisms in hippocampus, perirhinal and
   entorhinal cortex are gradually malfunctioning upon long-term daily
   exposure, a phenotype that persists for at least 2 weeks after
   interruption of radiation, returning to normal memory performance levels
   4 weeks later. It is postulated that cellular repair mechanisms are
   operating to eliminate the memory affecting molecules. The overall
   contribution of several possible mechanisms to the observed cumulative
   and transient impairments in spatial and non-spatial memory is
   discussed.
