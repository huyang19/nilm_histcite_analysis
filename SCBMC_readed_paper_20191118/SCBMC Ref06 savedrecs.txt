AB One fundamental question in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks
   (WRSNs) is the energy provisioning problem, i.e., how to deploy energy
   sources in a network to ensure that the nodes can harvest sufficient
   energy for continuous operation. Though the potential mobility of nodes
   has been exploited to reduce the number of sources necessary in energy
   provisioning problem in existing literature, the non-negligible impacts
   of the constraints of node speed and battery capacity on energy
   provisioning arc completely overlooked, in order to simplify the
   analysis.
   In this paper, we propose a new metric Quality of Energy Provisioning
   (QoEP) to characterize the expected portion of time that a mobile node
   can sustain normal operation in WRSNs, which factors in the constraints
   of node speed and battery capacity. To avoid confining the analysis to a
   specific mobility model, we study spatial distribution instead. We
   investigate the upper and lower bounds of QoEP in one-dimensional case
   with one single source and multiple sources respectively. For single
   source case, we prove the tight lower bound and upper bound of QoEP.
   Extending the results to multiple sources, we obtain tight lower bound
   and relaxed upper bound in normal cases, together with tight upper bound
   for one special case. Moreover, we give the tight lower bounds in both
   2D and 3D cases. Finally, we perform extensive simulations to verify our
   findings. Simulation results show that our bounds perfectly hold, and
   outperform the former works.
