AB Wireless power transfer technology is considered as one of the promising
   solutions to address the energy limitation problems for end-devices, but
   its incurred potential risk of electromagnetic radiation (EMR) exposure
   is largely overlooked by most existing works. In this paper, we consider
   the Safe Charging with Adjustable PowEr (SCAPE) problem, namely, how to
   adjust the power of chargers to maximize the charging utility of
   devices, while assuring that EMR intensity at any location in the field
   does not exceed a given threshold R-t. We present novel techniques to
   reformulate SCAPE into a traditional linear programming problem, and
   then remove its redundant constraints as much as possible to reduce
   computational effort. Next, we propose a distributed algorithm with
   provable approximation ratio (1 - epsilon). Through extensive simulation
   and testbed experiments, we demonstrate that our (1 -
   epsilon)-approximation algorithm outperforms the Set-Cover algorithm by
   up to 23%, and has an average performance gain of 41.1% over the SCP
   algorithm in terms of the overall charging utility.
