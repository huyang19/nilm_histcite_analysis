AB Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs) can be recharged after
   deployment for sustainable operations. Recent works propose to use a
   single mobile charger (MC) traveling through the network fields to
   recharge every sensor node. These algorithms work well in small scale
   networks. However, in large scale networks these algorithms do not work
   efficiently, especially when the amount of energy the MC can provide is
   limited. To address these challenges, multiple MCs can be used. In this
   paper, we investigate the minimum MCs problem (MinMCP) for rechargeable
   sensor networks: how to find the minimum number of energy-constrained
   MCs and design their recharging routes given a sensor network such that
   each sensor node in the WRSN maintains continuous work. Our results are
   three folds. We first prove that for any epsilon > 0, there is no
   (2-epsilon)-approximation algorithm for Distance Constrained Vehicle
   Routing Problem (DVRP) on a general metric space, which is the best as
   far as we know. By reducing from DVRP, we prove that MinMCP is NP-hard,
   and the inapproximability bound for MinMCP is the same as that of DVRP.
   Then we propose approximation algorithms for this problem. Finally, we
   conduct simulations to validate the effectiveness of our algorithms.
