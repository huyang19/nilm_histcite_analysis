AB Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are effective for locating and tracking
   people and objects in various industrial environments. Since energy
   consumption is critical to prolonging the lifespan of WSNs, we propose
   an energy-efficient LOcalization and Tracking (eLOT) system, using
   low-cost and portable hardware to enable highly accurate tracking of
   targets. Various fingerprint based approaches for localization and
   tracking are implemented in eLOT. To achieve high energy efficiency, a
   network-level scheme coordinating collision and interference is
   proposed. On the other hand, based on the location information, mobile
   devices in eLOT can quickly associate with the specific channel in a
   given area, while saving energy by avoiding unnecessary transmission.
   Finally, a platform based on TI CC2530 and the Linux operating system is
   built to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme in terms
   of localization accuracy and energy efficiency.
