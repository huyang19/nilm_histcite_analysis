AB StarLight is an infrastructure-based sensing system that reuses light
   emitted from ceiling LED panels to reconstruct fine-grained user
   skeleton postures continuously in real time. It leverages only a few
   (e.g., 20) photodiodes at optimized locations on the floor to capture
   low-level visual cues (light blockage information), with neither
   invasive cameras nor on-body sensors. It aggregates the blockage
   information of different light rays and identifies the best-fit 3D
   skeleton postures. Experiments show that StarLight achieves 13.6deg mean
   angular error for five body joints and reconstructs a mobile skeleton at
   a high frame rate (40 FPS). StarLight presents a new unobtrusive sensing
   paradigm to augment today's mobile sensing for continuous and accurate
   behavioral monitoring.
