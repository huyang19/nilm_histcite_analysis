AB It is a challenging issue to improve the energy efficiency of neighbor discovery in WSNs. This paper proposes an optimal discovery model (ODM) for the first time. Based on the model, we investigate the influence of the relative size of two unequal active slots on the energy efficiency. ODM provides the energy optimal value of the length of the larger active slot at a given duty cycle. Other than existing methods, the worst-case latency bound of ODM is only one period. This is a subversive conclusion, because almost all other related methods are based on a wake-up schedule that contains several periods. We theoretically deduce that ODM can reduce worst-case discovery latency by 43.89% compared to Searchlight-Trim when their duty cycles are the same. The simulations verify the advantage of ODM.

AB With the quick development of Internet of Things (IoT), one of its important supporting technologies, i.e., wireless sensor networks (WSNs), gets much more attention. Neighbor discovery is an indispensable procedure in WSNs. The existing deterministic neighbor discovery algorithms in WSNs ensure that successful discovery can be obtained within a given period of time, but the average discovery delay is long. It is difficult to meet the need for rapid discovery in mobile low duty cycle environments. In addition, with the rapid development of IoT, the node densities of many WSNs greatly increase. In such scenarios, existing neighbor discovery methods fail to satisfy the requirement in terms of discovery latency under the condition of the same energy consumption. This paper proposes a group-based fast neighbor discovery algorithm (GBFA) to address the issues. By carrying neighbor information in beacon packet, the node knows in advance some potential neighbors. It selects more energy efficient potential neighbors and proactively makes nodes wake up to verify whether these potential neighbors are true neighbors, thereby speeding up neighbor discovery, improving energy utilization efficiency and decreasing network communication load. The evaluation results indicate that, compared with other methods, GBFA decreases the average discovery latency up to at the same energy budget.

DE Low Duty Cycle WSNs; Neighbor Discovery; Deterministic Algorithm
AB In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), due to the limited energy of nodes, discovering neighbors needs to be achieved in an energy-efficient way. This means that, at a given energy consumption, we need to reduce the worst-case neighbor discovery latency as far as possible. In this letter, we propose a novel deterministic neighbor discovery method, called Lightning. Lightning employs two kinds of active slots of different active lengths (we call A slot and C slot, respectively). The active time of C slot is much shorter than that of A slot in order to reduce the energy consumption. In addition, to maximize the energy efficiency, Lightning adopts one-way neighbor discovery method. This makes C slot have the smallest active length that is only enough to send one beaconing packet. Through proactively sending one beaconing packet after one-way discovery, Lightning also realizes bi-directional neighbor discovery. The theoretical analysis indicates that, with the same energy consumption, our method reduces the worst-case latency bound up to 37.9% compared with Searchlight-Trim, the best existing discovery algorithm. The simulation verifies the soundness and effectiveness of our design.
