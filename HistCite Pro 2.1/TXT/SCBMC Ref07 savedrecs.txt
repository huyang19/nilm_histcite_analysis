AB Wireless charging technology is considered as one of the promising
   solutions to solve the energy limitation problem for large-scale
   wireless sensor networks. Obviously, charger deployment is a critical
   issue since the number of chargers would be limited by the network
   construction budget, which makes the full-coverage deployment of
   chargers infeasible. In many of the applications targeted by large-scale
   wireless sensor networks, end-devices are usually equipped by the human
   and their movement follows some degree of regularity. Therefore in this
   paper, we utilize this property to deploy chargers with partial
   coverage, with an objective to maximize the survival rate of
   end-devices. We prove this problem is NP-hard, and propose an algorithm
   to tackle it. The simulation results show that our proposed algorithm
   can significantly increase the survival rate of end-devices. To our
   knowledge, this is one of very first works that consider charger
   deployment with partial coverage in wireless rechargeable sensor
   networks.
