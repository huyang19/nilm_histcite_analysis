AB This paper explores the feasibility of localizing and detecting
   activities of building occupants using visible light sensing across a
   mesh of light bulbs. Existing Visible Light activity sensing (VLS)
   techniques require either light sensors to be deployed on the floor or a
   person to carry a device. Our approach integrates photosensors with
   light bulbs and exploits the light reflected off the floor to achieve an
   entirely device-free and light source based system. This forms a mesh of
   virtual light barriers across networked lights to track shadows cast by
   occupants. The design employs a synchronization circuit that implements
   a time division signaling scheme to differentiate between light sources
   and a sensitive sensing circuit to detect small changes in weak
   reflections. Sensor readings are fed into indoor supervised tracking
   algorithms as well as occupancy and activity recognition classifiers.
   Our prototype uses modified off-the-shelf LED flood light bulbs and is
   installed in a typical office conference room. We evaluate the
   performance of our system in terms of localization, occupancy estimation
   and activity classification, and find a 0.89m median localization error
   as well as 93.7% and 93.78% occupancy and activity classification
   accuracy, respectively.
