AB Compared with the localization methods in the static sensor networks,
   node localization in dynamic sensor networks is more complicated due to
   the mobility of the nodes. Dynamic Sampling Localization Algorithm Based
   on Virtual Anchor (DSLA) is proposed in this paper to localize the
   unknown nodes in dynamic sensor networks. Firstly, DSLA algorithm
   predicts the speed and movement direction of nodes to determine a sector
   sampling area. Secondly, a method of calculating the sampling quantity
   with the size of the sampling area dynamically changing is proposed in
   this paper. Lastly, the virtual anchor node, i.e., the unknown node that
   got the preliminary possible area (PLA), assists the other unknown nodes
   to reduce their PLAs. The last PLA is regarded as a filtering condition
   to filter out the conflicting sample points quickly. In this way, the
   filtered sample is close to its real coordinates. The simulation results
   show that the DSLA algorithm can greatly improve the positioning
   performance when ensuring the execution time is shorter and the
   localization coverage rate is higher. The localization error of the DSLA
   algorithm can be dropped to about 20%.
