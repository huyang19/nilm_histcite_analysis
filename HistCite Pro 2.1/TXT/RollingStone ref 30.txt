AB Indoor localization is becoming critical to empower Internet of Things
   for various applications, such as asset tracking, autonomous parking,
   virtual reality, context awareness, condition monitoring, geolocation,
   smart manufacturing, as well as smart cities. It is well known that
   indoor localization based on some single fingerprints is rather
   susceptible to the changing environment. The efficiency of building
   single fingerprints from one localization system is also low. Recently,
   we first proposed a group of fingerprints (GOOF) based localization to
   improve the efficiency of building fingerprints, and then proposed an
   efficient fusion algorithm, namely, multiple classifiers multiple
   samples (MUCUS), to improve the accuracy of localization. However, the
   main drawbacks of MUCUS are the low localization efficiency and low
   accuracy when all classifiers show poor performance simultaneously. In
   this paper, based on the aforementioned GOOF, we propose a sliding
   window aided mode-based (SWIM) fusion algorithm to balance the
   localization accuracy and efficiency. SWIM first adopts windowing and
   sliding techniques to improve the localization efficiency, and then
   obtains a more accurate estimate by minimizing the entropy of multiple
   classifiers or multiple samples. This can guarantee our estimator to be
   robust to changing environment and larger noise level. We demonstrate
   the performance of our algorithms through simulations and real
   experimental data via two universal software radio peripheral platforms.
