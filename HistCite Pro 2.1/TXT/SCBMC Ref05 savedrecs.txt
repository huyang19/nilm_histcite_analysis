AB Wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs) have emerged as an
   alternative to solving the challenges of size and operation time posed
   by traditional battery-powered systems. In this paper, we study a WRSN
   built from the industrial wireless identification and sensing platform
   (WISP) and commercial off-the-shelf RFID readers. The paper-thin WISP
   tags serve as sensors and can harvest energy from RF signals transmitted
   by the readers. This kind of WRSNs is highly desirable for indoor
   sensing and activity recognition and is gaining attention in the
   research community. One fundamental question in WRSN design is how to
   deploy readers in a network to ensure that the WISP tags can harvest
   sufficient energy for continuous operation. We refer to this issue as
   the energy provisioning problem. Based on a practical wireless recharge
   model supported by experimental data, we investigate two forms of the
   problem: point provisioning and path provisioning. Point provisioning
   uses the least number of readers to ensure that a static tag placed in
   any position of the network will receive a sufficient recharge rate for
   sustained operation. Path provisioning exploits the potential mobility
   of tags (e.g., those carried by human users) to further reduce the
   number of readers necessary: mobile tags can harvest excess energy in
   power-rich regions and store it for later use in power-deficient
   regions. Our analysis shows that our deployment methods, by exploiting
   the physical characteristics of wireless recharging, can greatly reduce
   the number of readers compared with those assuming traditional coverage
   models.
