AB One of the challenging problems in collaborative position localization
   arises when the distance measurements contain non-line-of-sight (NLOS)
   biases. Convex optimization has played a major role in modelling such
   problems and numerical algorithm developments. One of the successful
   examples is the semi-definite programming (SDP), which translates
   Euclidean distances into the constraints of positive semidefinite
   matrices, leading to a large number of constraints in the case of NLOS
   biases. In this paper, we propose a new convex optimization model that
   is built upon the concept of Euclidean distance matrix (EDM). The
   resulting EDM optimization has an advantage that its Lagrangian dual
   problem is well structured and hence is conducive to algorithm
   developments. We apply a recently proposed 3-block alternating direction
   method of multipliers to the dual problem and tested the algorithm on
   some real as well as simulated data of large scale. In particular, the
   EDM model significantly outperforms the existing SDP model and several
   others.
