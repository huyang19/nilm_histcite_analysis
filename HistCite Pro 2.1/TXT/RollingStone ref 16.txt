AB Iterative point-wise reinforcement learning (IPWRL) is proposed for
   highly accurate indoor visible light positioning (VLP). By properly
   updating the height information in an iterative fashion., the IPWRL not
   only effectively mitigates the impact of non-deterministic noise but
   also exhibits excellent tolerance to deterministic errors caused by the
   inaccurate a priori height information. The principle of the IPWRL is
   explained, and the performance of the IPWRL is experimentally evaluated
   in a received signal strength (RSS) based VLP system and compared with
   other positioning algorithms, including the conventional RSS algorithm,
   the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm and the PWRL algorithm where
   iterations exclude. Unlike the supervised machine learning method, e.g.,
   the KNN, whose performance is highly dependent on the training process,
   the proposed IPWRL does not require training and demonstrates robust
   positioning performance for the entire tested area. Experimental results
   also show that when a large height information mismatch occurs, the
   IPWRL is able to first correct the height information and then offers
   robust positioning results with a rather low positioning error, while
   the positioning errors caused by the other algorithms are significantly
   higher. (C) 2019 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA
