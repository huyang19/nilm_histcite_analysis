AB Recent years have witnessed several new promising technologies to power
   wireless sensor networks, which motivate some key topics to be
   revisited. By integrating sensing and computation capabilities to the
   traditional radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, the Wireless
   Identification and Sensing Platform (WISP) is an open-source platform
   acting as a pioneering experimental platform of wireless rechargeable
   sensor networks. Different from traditional tags, an RFID-based wireless
   rechargeable sensor node needs to charge its onboard energy storage
   above a threshold to power its sensing, computation, and communication
   components. Consequently, such charging delay imposes a unique design
   challenge for deploying wireless rechargeable sensor networks. In this
   paper, we tackle this problem by planning the optimal movement strategy
   of the mobile RFID reader, such that the time to charge all nodes in the
   network above their energy threshold is minimized. We first propose an
   optimal solution using the linear programming (LP) method. To further
   reduce the computational complexity, we then introduce a heuristic
   solution with a provable approximation ratio of (1 + theta)/(1 -
   epsilon) by discretizing the charging power on a 2-D space. Through
   extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that our design outperforms the
   set-cover-based design by an average of 24.7%, whereas the computational
   complexity is O((N/epsilon)(2)). Finally, we consider two practical
   issues in system implementation and provide guidelines for parameter
   setting.
