AB The existing cell phone certification process uses a plastic model of
   the head called the Specific Anthropomorphic Mannequin (SAM),
   representing the top 10% of U. S. military recruits in 1989 and greatly
   underestimating the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) for typical mobile
   phone users, especially children. A superior computer simulation
   certification process has been approved by the Federal Communications
   Commission (FCC) but is not employed to certify cell phones. In the
   United States, the FCC determines maximum allowed exposures. Many
   countries, especially European Union members, use the "guidelines" of
   International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP),
   a non governmental agency. Radiofrequency (RF) exposure to a head
   smaller than SAM will absorb a relatively higher SAR. Also, SAM uses a
   fluid having the average electrical properties of the head that cannot
   indicate differential absorption of specific brain tissue, nor
   absorption in children or smaller adults. The SAR for a 10-year old is
   up to 153% higher than the SAR for the SAM model. When electrical
   properties are considered, a child's head's absorption can be over two
   times greater, and absorption of the skull's bone marrow can be ten
   times greater than adults. Therefore, a new certification process is
   needed that incorporates different modes of use, head sizes, and tissue
   properties. Anatomically based models should be employed in revising
   safety standards for these ubiquitous modern devices and standards
   should be set by accountable, independent groups.
