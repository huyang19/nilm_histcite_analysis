AB As battery-powered mobile devices become more popular and energy hungry,
   wireless power transfer technology receives intensive interests, as it
   allows the power to be transferred from a charger to ambient devices
   wirelessly. The existing studies mainly focus on the power transfer
   efficiency but overlook the health impairments caused by RF exposure. In
   this paper, we study the Safe Charging Problem (SCP) of scheduling power
   chargers so that more energy can be received while no location in the
   field has electromagnetic radiation (EMR) exceeding a given threshold
   R-t. We prove that SCP is NP-hard and propose a solution which provably
   outperforms the optimal solution to SCP with a relaxed EMR threshold (1
   - epsilon) R-t. Testbed results based on 8 Powercast TX91501 chargers
   validate our results. Extensive simulation results show that the gap
   between our solution and the optimal one is only 6.7% when epsilon =
   0.1, while a naive greedy algorithm is 34.6% below our solution.
