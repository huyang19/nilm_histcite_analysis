AB In this paper, we proposed a system that realized simultaneously visible
   light positioning (VLP) and visible light communications (VLC) in the
   same band by using orthogonal frequency division multiple access
   (OFDMA). This system used the power of data sequence as the metric to
   estimate the transmission distances and consequently the receiver's
   position, without deteriorating the VLC's throughput. We theoretically
   analyzed the positioning errors in both overdetermined and determined
   VLP systems. In overdetermined VLP system, optimal selection of master
   light-emitting diode (LED) avoided the fluctuation of positioning error.
   Excluding the LED with longest transmission distance changed the
   overdetermined VLP system to determined VLP system, and reduced the
   positioning error. The power allocation scheme reduced further the
   positioning error in determined VLP system. This method was fast and
   effective. The well-matched theoretical and Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation
   results validated our proposed VLP based on VLC system using OFDMA. (C)
