AB A novel concept is proposed for integrating optical wireless visible
   light communications with 3-D indoor positioning using a single
   transmitter and multiple tilted optical receivers. We modeled a channel
   link, which was based on the transmitter and receiver characteristic
   data obtained in this experiment. The proposed 3-D positioning algorithm
   is based on gain difference, which is a function of the angle of arrival
   and the received signal strength. Our demonstration shows that the
   proposed algorithm can determine accurate positions, including height,
   without intercell interference.
