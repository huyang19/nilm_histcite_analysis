AB As the interdiscipline of wireless communication and control
   engineering, the cooperative charging issue in wireless rechargeable
   sensor networks (WRSNs) is a popular research problem. With the help of
   wireless power transfer technology, electrical energy can be transferred
   from wireless charging vehicles to sensors, providing a new paradigm to
   prolong the network lifetime. However, existing techniques on
   cooperative charging usually take the periodical and deterministic
   approach but neglect the influences of the nondeterministic factors such
   as topological changes and node failures, making them unsuitable for
   large-scale WRSNs. In this paper, we develop a primary and passer-by
   scheduling ((PS)-S-2) algorithm for on-demand charging architecture for
   large-scale WRSNs. In (PS)-S-2, task interdependence is utilized to
   enhance charging efficiency. We exploit a local searching algorithm, in
   which nearby nodes on the way to primary nodes, which are the targets of
   wireless charging vehicle's current movement, will be charged as
   passer-by nodes. Such a strategy not only makes full use of the
   available remaining time of a charging deadline but solves the complex
   scheduling problem with spatial and temporal task interdependence as
   well. Analysis and simulations are conducted to show the superiority of
   our scheme, revealing that (PS)-S-2 has a higher survival rate and
   throughput, as well as other performance metrics.
