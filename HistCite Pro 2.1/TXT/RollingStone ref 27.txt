AB A new exact, explicit, and computationally efficient solution for
   three-dimensional (3-D) position estimation based on range measurements
   from three stations is proposed. The simple polynomial-type form of the
   new algorithm facilitates the performance analysis. Formulae are
   provided for both the variance and the bias of the position estimates.
   The systematic error is a joint effect of both the measurement noise and
   the system nonlinearity and its magnitude cannot be ignored if highly
   accurate localization is required Performance evaluation results are
   presented for various conditions.
